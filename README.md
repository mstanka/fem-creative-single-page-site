# [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge - Creative single page site

![Design preview for the Creative single page site coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this single-page website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I could use any tools I liked to help me complete the challenge.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard
